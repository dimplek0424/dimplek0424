# 👋 Hi, I’m Dimple Khatri

I turn complex real-world problems into clean, scalable systems — blending my expertise in **Java backend engineering** with hands-on innovation in **AI/ML and GenAI**.

- Currently building **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** systems, **AI agents**, enterprise-ready **LLM integrations**, and **cloud-native microservices** for domains like healthcare, education, and e-commerce.
- Passionate about bridging the gap between engineering and applied research through **explainable GenAI** and open-source tooling.

## 💬 What I Love Talking About
- Writing expressive, modern **Java code** — from Java 6 in 2015 to Java 8 to Java 17+ today (always ready for what's next)
- Turning AI prototypes into production systems  
- RAG workflows that actually retrieve the right context 😉  
- Making backend systems as lovable as frontend ones — clean, performant, and joyful to build

## 🧪 What I'm Researching & Building

I'm currently exploring how to bridge applied engineering with research-driven AI tools, particularly in the following areas:

- Prototyping ways to **integrate Java-based backends with LLM APIs** — making GenAI accessible to enterprise-grade systems
- **GenAI frameworks** like LangChain, LangGraph & Bedrock Agents  
- **RAG agents** with persistent memory and vector-backed QA  
- **Cloud-first AI pipelines** across AWS, GCP, and Terraform
- **Explainable GenAI** for healthcare and education
- **Training small LLMs** for the right use cases — balancing performance, cost, and relevance
  
Most of these ideas will surface in my open-source work (Aug–Oct 2025).

---

🧭 **Long-term:** I aim to contribute to responsible AI through interdisciplinary research and real-world applications — blending systems engineering with domain-specific AI.
