# 👋 Hi, I’m Dimple Khatri

🔍 I transform messy real-world problems into clean, scalable code — and I love building AI-powered systems that make a meaningful difference.

Currently exploring how GenAI, RAG pipelines, AI Agents, and multi-cloud orchestration can power the next generation of intelligent products, especially in healthcare and education.
I’m also pursuing research in explainable GenAI and clinical knowledge retrieval, aiming to bridge the gap between engineering and applied research through open-source tools and publications.

## 🧪 What I'm Researching & Building

I'm currently exploring how to bridge applied engineering with research-driven AI tools, particularly in the following areas:

- **GenAI frameworks** like LangChain, LangGraph & Bedrock Agents  
- **RAG agents** with persistent memory and vector-backed QA  
- **Cloud-first AI pipelines** across AWS, GCP, and Terraform
- **Explainable GenAI** for healthcare and education
- **Training small LLMs** for the right use cases — balancing performance, cost, and relevance

Many of these ideas will surface in my open-source projects above (Aug–Oct 2025).

---

## 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on...
- **Healthcare & EdTech GenAI tools**  
- **LLM-based research or open-source projects**  
- Community-driven **tech mentoring & workshops**

---

## 💬 What I Love Talking About
- Turning AI prototypes into production systems  
- RAG workflows that actually retrieve the right context 😉  
- Making backend systems as lovable as frontend ones
